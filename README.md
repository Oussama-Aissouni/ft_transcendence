We had an amazing time on our website, where users enjoyed playing Pong together. We crafted a sleek user interface, introduced a chat feature, and hosted real-time multiplayer online games! Our journey followed these guidelines:

Our backend was crafted with NestJS, ensuring a solid foundation.
For the frontend, we embraced a TypeScript framework, adding our touch of creativity.
Embracing libraries of our choice, we made sure to stay current with the latest stable versions.
PostgreSQL became our database of choice; simplicity and efficiency in one.
Our website, a dynamic single-page application, allowed users to navigate seamlessly with the Back and Forward buttons.
Compatibility was key, ensuring a smooth experience on the latest versions of Google Chrome and another browser of our choice.
The user's journey was error-free and warning-free, creating a hassle-free browsing experience.
Launching everything with a single call: docker-compose up --build.
In addition, we delved into creating a vibrant chat experience:

Users could create public, private, or password-protected chat rooms, shaping their interaction.
Direct messages flowed effortlessly between users, fostering connections.
Users had the power to block others, tailoring their chat experience.
Channel creators automatically became owners, with the ability to set passwords and manage access.
Channel owners, also administrators, had the authority to appoint other administrators.
Administrators could manage user interactions within the channel.
Playing Pong and connecting took a new turn with the ability to invite others through the chat interface.
Exploring other players' profiles became a seamless part of the chat experience.
